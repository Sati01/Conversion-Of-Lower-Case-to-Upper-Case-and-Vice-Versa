# Conversion-Of-Lower-Case-to-Upper-Case-and-Vice-Versa
Here we convert lower case characters to upper case and vice versa


This is a basic case convertion project using tkinter module which is used to build basic "GUI" window here we have used basic python functions and a couple of other functions like isupper() to check whether the given string is in uppercase or not then we have used .set() to point the converted string to the same box where we give our input string then in another function we have built the structure of the "GUI" window using tkinter.
